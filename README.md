RevealJs source for the slides of my [talk at CppCon 2022](https://vvnraman.github.io/cppcon-2022-cpp-neovim/).

## Building slides

### Locally

- Install nodejs
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### Publish to Github Pages

The `gulpfile.js` has a few edits to make `gulp package` work. This is then
exposed via a new `npm run package` command.

- Obtain a `reveal-js-presentation.zip` file
  ```sh
  npm run package
  ```
- Switch over to the `gh-pages` branch
  ```sh
  git worktree add ../gh-pages gh-pages
  ```
- Extract zip file into gh-pages branch
  ```sh
  unzip ../master/reveal-js-presentation.zip
  ```
- Add everything to git, commit and push
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Updated `date`"
  git push github gh-pages # github is the name of my github.com remote
  ```
